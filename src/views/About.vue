        Hi, I’m <strong>Kelly</strong>. I’m a <strong>product manager</strong> by profession and a
        <strong>software engineer</strong> by education. In my free time, I volunteer as a
        <strong>Chapter Leader</strong> for
        <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/" class="about-gdi">
          <strong>Girl Develop It</strong>
        </a>,
        a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating welcoming and supportive opportunities for
        women and non-binary adults to learn software development skills.

        I love organization (a lot) and obsessively organize all aspects of my life. I am a huge
        fan of containers, both virtual and physical, and adamantly believe that things belong in
        other things. Fittingly, my favorite HTML tag is the &lt;div&gt;, and my favorite store is
        The Container Store.
